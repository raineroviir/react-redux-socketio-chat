## Use Guide

[Korean translation](/README_KOR.md)

First off, clone the repository and then `cd react-redux-socketio-chat`and `npm install`

You can create channels with the + sign on the nav bar on the left.
If you click on a user's name to send him a private message (opens a private channel)

### Setting up MongoDB

Note: You need MongoDB set up and running to run the code locally. [Installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

Once you've installed MongoDB start up the MongoDB server in a new terminal with the following commands:

```
mkdir db
mongod --dbpath=./db --smallfiles
```

Then open a new terminal and type in `mongo` and type in `use chat_dev`
This is your database interface.  You can query the database for records for example: `db.users.find()` or `db.stats()`.  If you want to remove all channels for example you can type `db.channels.remove({})`.

Now that you've done all that, you can go go ahead and code away!
